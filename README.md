 # About this project
 This project is one of the ones i did during a course of Next and React. It is a simple game where you can generate some quantity of doors and you can select which door will have the gift. Is an implementation of the famous probability problem known as "Monty Hall". Inspired by the television show "Let's Make a Deal", the game features three doors, one of which hides a valuable prize. After making an initial choice, the player has the opportunity to switch doors before opening the chosen door. The optimal strategy is to always change doors, providing a greater chance of winning the prize.
